# ACCESS CONTROL APP

This app was built as a platform in which an organization could manage it employees' access to different facilities on a campus.


** BACKEND **
For this project, I created a total of 5 tables within my Postgres database: 
  - access_points
  - access_types
  - buildings
  - user_buildings
  - users
The relationships for these tables were created within the models.js page.

A seed database was created in which I added fields to the different tables.

I then created APIs within my app.js page that appear to be working (calling the correct data) based on some testing with Postman. 



** FRONTEND **
[[Figma File]](https://www.figma.com/design/cgowN1fqif7BguKeZ54eT1/Access-Control?node-id=0-1&t=Fayer86fxok6Nicw-1)

I used a Bootstrap template for the frontend. I purchased a template that I plan to use for other projects as well. The template I used had a page called "Members" that contained a UI that fit my initial Figma mockup.

I used React as the frontend framework.
